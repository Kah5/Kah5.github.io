    "text": "Forest Ecology\n\nMuch of my research focuses on forecasting the responses of forest (and temperate savanna) systems to ongoing and future environmental changes. Understanding the fate of these systems in the future is critical to preserving the myriad of ecosystem services that forests provide, including carbon uptake and sequestration, biodiversity, and biophysical feedbacks. My research aims to understand and forecast how environmental drivers and ecological feedbacks within forest systems interact to promote carbon storage, as increased carbon storage can feedback an mitigate some of the effects of future climate change. I have explored the relative roles of species interactions , fire disturbance vegetation-feedbacks within savanna-forest systems, and how forest structure modifies tree sensitivity to climate and response to increased atmospheric CO2.\n\nEnvironmental Change\n\nEcological systems face extensive environmental changes, including climate change, rising atmospheric CO2, changing fire regimes, and land use changes. My research is motivated by the need to forecast how ecological systems will respond to these concurrent changes, and potentially mitigate some of the worst effects. To do this, I look to past responses of forests to environmental changes in order to inform predictions of the future.\nSpecifically, I quantify past responses of tree growth to rising CO2 and concurrent changes in climate over the 20th century using tree rings. We find that while rising CO2 may have a small positive effect on tree growth, this is cancelled out by a drastic decrease in tree growth in response to a warmer future. I have also explored the effects of past climate and vegetation-disturbance feedbacks, quantifying the subsequent land-use driven collapse of alternative stable states at the temperate savanna-forest boundary. Within the ecoregion scale, I quantified the relative roles that environmental gradients and species interactions play in determining species aboveground biomass distribution, allowing us to better predict changes in biomass due to both climatic change, and land-use driven the loss of species interactions.\n\nEcological Forecasting\n\nWe are currently facing and will continue to face drastic environmental changes that will undoubtedly change the functioning of our societal and natural ecosystems. While predicting how future systems will respond is critical, high uncertainty about future forecasts remains. Ecological forecasting allows us to understand the processes affecting ecosystem response, quantify the contribution of current/past processes on ecosystem response (with associated uncertainties), and based on that relationship predict system responses to future environmental change (with associated uncertainties).\nThe process of making ecological forecasts will help us understand the range of future responses of ecological systems, quantify which aspects of the future are highly uncertain, and inform management decisions to promote resiliency. In my post-doctoral research, I am fusing tree-ring and forest inventory data to make forecasts about forest responses to climate change, and to identify forest management strategies (changes in forest stocking density, average tree size, etc.) that maximize resilience to extreme climate conditions."

    "text": "Human activity has the potential to collapse vegetation at the biome scale from one stable state to another, but well-documented instances of changes in biome stability are scarce. Demonstrating such a collapse requires evidence that vegetation had alternative states before an intensification of human activity, and that it subsequently stabilized to a single state. We reconstructed a biome-scale state shift across the U.S. upper Midwest based on historical (mid-1800’s) and contemporary (1999 - 2016) vegetation survey data. Before extensive fire suppression, logging, and land use conversion, vegetation structure and composition were bimodal with respect to the environment, but now consist of a single stable forested state that would have been unstable in the historical period. This collapse of historical vegetation carries cautionary parallels to modern multiple-stable-state systems facing anthropogenic changes."

    "text": "Abstract\nHistorically, closed eastern forests transitioned into open savannas and prairies in the U.S. Midwest, but this transition is poorly understood. To investigate the eastern boundary of the prairie-forest ecotone, we conducted a case study of historic and modern vegetation patterns of the Yellow River watershed in northwest Indiana. Historic vegetation came from the Public Land Survey notes collected in the early 1800s, whereas modern vegetation came from the Forest Inventory Analysis and USGS National Land Cover Database. We mapped vegetation data using GIS to reconstruct the region’s past and current forest composition and structure. We also mapped climate, topography, and soil composition across the watershed to investigate the relationship between historic vegetation and environmental gradients. We found a sharp transition in the presettlement forest structure and composition, with dense deciduous forests in the eastern portion of our study area and open oak savannas in the west. The savanna ecosystem dominated in sandy well-drained soils and was at a slightly lower elevation than the adjacent closed forest. Modest environmental changes accompanied major vegetation changes in the past, which might suggest fire and hydrological patterns helped maintain the sharp ecotone. By contrast the modern forest shows no difference in tree density and composition across the watershed, which is consistent with major land use and hydrology changes in the watershed since settlement. On the modern landscape, land that was historically closed forest now has higher agricultural productivity compared to land that was historically savanna, whereas the historic savanna currently supports more mesic forest. These results suggest the environmental gradient continues to subtly shape the landscape. Though land use change has largely removed the closed mixed hardwood forests and oak savannas from this area, a better understanding of the historic vegetation and the conditions that supported it can help inform land management and restoration, as well as reveal ecological processes that drive vegetation transitions."

    "text": "Abstract:\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) is increasing, which increases leaf-scale photosynthesis and intrinsic water-use efficiency. These direct responses have the potential to increase plant growth, vegetation biomass, and soil organic matter; transferring carbon from the atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems (a carbon sink). A substantial global terrestrial carbon sink would slow the rate of [CO2] increase and thus climate change. However, ecosystem CO2 responses are complex or confounded by concurrent changes in multiple agents of global change and evidence for a [CO2]-driven terrestrial carbon sink can appear contradictory. Here we synthesize theory and broad, multidisciplinary evidence for the effects of increasing [CO2] (iCO2) on the global terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence suggests a substantial increase in global photosynthesis since pre-industrial times. Established theory, supported by experiments, indicates that iCO2 is likely responsible for about half of the increase. Global carbon budgeting, atmospheric data, and forest inventories indicate a historical carbon sink, and these apparent iCO2 responses are high in comparison to experiments and predictions from theory. Plant mortality and soil carbon iCO2 responses are highly uncertain. In conclusion, a range of evidence supports a positive terrestrial carbon sink in response to iCO2, albeit with uncertain magnitude and strong suggestion of a role for additional agents of global change."

    "text": "Abstract:\nGiven the importance of climate in shaping species’ geographic distributions, climate change poses an existential threat to biodiversity. Climate envelope modeling, the pre- dominant approach used to quantify this threat, presumes that individuals in populations respond to climate variability and change according to species-level responses inferred from spatial occurrence data—such that individuals at the cool edge of a species’ dis- tribution should benefit from warming (the “leading edge”), whereas individuals at the warm edge should suffer (the “trailing edge”). Using 1,558 tree-ring time series of an aridland pine (Pinus edulis) collected at 977 locations across the species’ distribution, we found that trees everywhere grow less in warmer-than-average and drier-than-average years. Ubiquitous negative temperature sensitivity indicates that individuals across the entire distribution should suffer with warming—the entire distribution is a trailing edge. Species-level responses to spatial climate variation are opposite in sign to individual-scale responses to time-varying climate for approximately half the species’ distribution with respect to temperature and the majority of the species’ distribution with respect to precipitation. These findings, added to evidence from the literature for scale-dependent climate responses in hundreds of species, suggest that correlative, equilibrium-based range forecasts may fail to accurately represent how individuals in populations will be impacted by changing climate. A scale-dependent view of the impact of climate change on biodiversity highlights the transient risk of extinction hidden inside climate envelope forecasts and the importance of evolution in rescuing species from extinction whenever local climate variability and change exceeds individual-scale climate tolerances."

    "text": "Abstract:\nThe oak (Quercus) species of eastern North America are declining in abundance, threatening the many socioecological benefits they provide. We discuss the mechanisms responsible for their loss, many of which are rooted in the prevailing view that oaks are drought tolerant. We then synthesize previously published data to comprehensively review the drought response strategies of eastern US oaks, concluding that whether or not eastern oaks are drought tolerant depends firmly on the metric of success. Although the anisohydric strategy of oaks sometimes confers a gas exchange and growth advantage, it exposes oaks to damaging hydraulic failure, such that oaks are just as or more likely to perish during drought than neighboring species. Consequently, drought frequency is not a strong predictor of historic patterns of oak abundance, although long-term climate and fire frequency are strongly correlated with declines in oak dominance. The oaks’ ability to survive drought may become increasingly difficult in a drier future."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRobust ecological forecasting of tree growth under future climate conditions is critical to anticipate future forest carbon storage and flux. Here, we apply three ingredients of ecological forecasting that are key to improving forecast skill: data fusion, confronting model predictions with new data, and partitioning forecast uncertainty. Specifically, we present the first fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data within a Bayesian state-space model at a multi-site, regional scale, focusing on Pinus ponderosa var. brachyptera in the southwestern US. Leveraging the complementarity of these two data sources, we parsed the ecological complexity of tree growth into the effects of climate, tree size, stand density, site quality, and their interactions, and quantified uncertainties associated with these effects. New measurements of trees, an ongoing process in forest inventories, were used to confront forecasts of tree diameter with observations, and evaluate alternative tree growth models. We forecasted tree diameter and increment in response to an ensemble of climate change projections, and separated forecast uncertainty into four different causes: initial conditions, parameters, climate drivers, and process error. We found a strong negative effect of fall–spring maximum temperature, and a positive effect of water-year precipitation on tree growth. Furthermore, tree vulnerability to climate stress increases with greater competition, with tree size, and at poor sites. Under future climate scenarios, we forecast increment declines of 22%–117%, while the combined effect of climate and size-related trends results in a 56%–91% decline. Partitioning of forecast uncertainty showed that diameter forecast uncertainty is primarily caused by parameter and initial conditions uncertainty, but increment forecast uncertainty is mostly caused by process error and climate driver uncertainty. This fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data lays the foundation for robust ecological forecasting of aboveground biomass and carbon accounting at tree, plot, and regional scales, including iterative improvement of model skill."

Here is a bit more on what to expect:\n\nCode & tutorials:\nIn my research, I have spent alot of time coding and learning new analyses, mostly in R/Rstudio. In this process, I have learned alot from forums, blogs, and other resources, and I plan to share some of this content (and hope it is useful).\n\n\nResearch:\nI hope to use this space to reflect on my recent research experiences, and highlight new publications. I may also do some reflections on past field work (with alot of pictures).\n\n\nTravel:\nI’ve had the great privilege and opportunity to travel for both work and fun. The only time pick up my journal is during these trips, mostly so I can remember what I did, what I saw, on which trails I traveled, and where I camped. I plan to share some of these reflections here as well. Since travel has been put on hold for awhile (writing this in May 2020), I may dig up some of these old trips to share."

    "text": "I just attended the annual meeting for Ecological Society of America (ESA), my first virtual conference! While I am disappointed that I couldn’t see everyone in person and visit Salt Lake City for the first time, virtual ESA 2020 had its benefits. It also had some downsides.\n\nThe Positives\nThe virtual format allowed me to interact with and digest the content of talks more easily. I could pause and look at figures & equations in detail, solving the age-old problem of presenters throwing a bunch of math onto a slide and expecting the audience to digest it in ~15 seconds (mea culpa). The ability to watch talks on my own time also meant that I could take the time I needed to jot down some notes, process, and reflect on the cool science I just heard about. I was also able to ask more questions and with more detail than in-person conferences. Also, if a talk wasn’t what I’d expected, I could get up and leave in the middle, which would be quite rude in-person–I promise I didn’t do this very often!\n\n\nThe Negatives\nHowever, virtual conferences come with some disadvantages. In particular, I had a lot of trouble accessing the synchronous live Q & A sessions, and I eventually gave up on this. I think that it will be hard to replace the interactions and networking that happens at in-person conferences, but hopefully we can come up with more creative solutions. I was disappointed that many people submitting only slides for the talks, which (to be honest) I haven’t taken the time to look though many of these yet. I understand that there may be some barriers to recording a talk–listening to my voice on video is one of my least favorite things, and it took a few tries to record–but the videos are more compelling, give way more information than just your slides, and you will reach a wider audience. Also, though the online format really lends itself to asking and answering questions, I was also disappointed at how few questions were asked on many of the talks I viewed. Perhaps some of these downsides can be improved upon, especially for conferences later this year which have more time switch to a virtual format, invest in hosting platforms, and develop new ways for us to interact in a COVID-19 world.\n\n\nWill Covid-19 change conferences for the better?\nShortcomings aside, we should all give major thanks to the organizing committee, who turned ESA into a virtual conference on a short time-frame. Transitioning to all-virtual conferences is certainly a change for most of us, but I hope this experience will make future conferences more accessible to all, less fossil-fuel intensive (by reducing travel), and provide a diversity of ways to interact with other scientists.\nAnother upside of virtual conferences is that I now have a recorded research talk to share with the world. If you missed ESA, you can check out my talk here!"

Although this inventory design is an “annual” design, each plot is remeasured on a cycle every ~5-10 years, such that estimates of forest C may miss year-to-year variations in tree or plot-level growth and C sequestration between remeasurements. Lack of year-to-year variation in these estimates makes it difficult to quantify the effect of annual climate variability and episodic events (fire disturbances, insect outbreaks, pathogens) on forest C trends. Here, we advance estimates of annual variability of diameter growth for &gt;15,000 trees from 17 common species of the Northeastern US using a suite of Bayesian state-space models, which link tree diameters and annual tree ring data from site trees associated with FIA plots in the 1980’s.\nModels that include competition indices, tree size, two species-specific climate variables, and site-level factors capture inter-annual variability in held out annual diameter increments. While the magnitude and sign of posterior estimates of explanatory covariates vary across species, inclusion of annual climate variability consistently improves prediction of annual diameter increments. Validation of these predictions with in-sample and held-out tree ring date indicates a RMSPE of 0.0006 and 0.097 respectively. Using the posterior estimates to predict annual diameter increments from the first measurement of the non-cored, tally trees between remeasurements produces climate sensitive estimates of growth for trees. We compare the state-space model estimates of annual growth to current methods (interpolation and averaging growth from two diameter measurements). Compared to interpolation, state-space estimation enabled with tree-ring data captures annual growth variability at the tree-level, which may indicate that current stock-difference approaches could underestimate variability of forest C sequestration at the plot-scale. This approach lays the foundation to scale this approach to stand-scale estimates of historic annual C sequestration needed to improve annual estimates of the forest C component of the US GHG inventory.\nReferences:\n\nSmith, R.

    "text": "Abstract:\nTree-ring time series provide long-term, annually resolved information on the growth of trees. When sampled in a systematic context, tree-ring data can be scaled to estimate the forest carbon capture and storage of landscapes, biomes, and—ultimately—the globe. A systematic effort to sample tree rings in national forest inventories would yield unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution of forest carbon dynamics and help resolve key scientific uncertainties, which we highlight in terms of evidence for forest greening (enhanced growth) versus browning (reduced growth, increased mortality). We describe jump-starting a tree-ring collection across the continent of North America, given the commitments of Canada, the United States, and Mexico to visit forest inventory plots, along with existing legacy collections. Failing to do so would be a missed opportunity to help chart an evidence-based path toward meeting national commitments to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions, urgently needed for climate stabilization and repair."

    "text": "Abstract:\nAs a party to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the United States has reported an inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals by sector every year, using the methodological guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), since the mid-1990s (U.S. EPA 2024). The United States is also party to the 2015 Paris Agreement. In 2024, the annual inventory supports both agreements for the first time. It follows guidelines under these agreements and presents information in a common and consistent format to assess the relative contribution of different GHG emissions and removals in the United States to climate change.\nIn 2022, U.S. net GHG emissions increased  by more than 1.3 percent relative to 2021 net  emissions, which had decreased substantially  from previous years due, in large part, to the  global COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. Forest  land, harvested wood products, woodlands,  and urban trees within the land sector  collectively continue to represent the largest  net carbon sink in the United States, removing  the equivalent of more than 14 percent of total  (i.e., gross) GHG emissions in 2022 (U.S. EPA  2024). U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),  Forest Service researchers and partners compile  estimates of GHG emissions and removals,  based primarily on Nationwide Forest Inventory  (NFI) data collected and maintained by the  Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program  within the Forest Service. This resource bulletin  provides an overview of the status and trends  of GHG emissions and removals from forest  land, harvested wood products, woodlands,  and urban trees in the United States from 1990  to 2022. The estimates summarized here are  based on the compilation reported in the “Land  Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry” chapter of  the U.S. EPA (2024) inventory submission to the  UNFCCC.\nThe published report and disaggregated estimates are available online at https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2024-0065."

    "text": "Abstract:\nBoth increases in temperature and changes in precipitation may limit future tree growth, but rising atmospheric CO2 could offset some of these stressors through increased plant Water Use Efficiency (WUE). The net balance between the negative impacts of climate change and positive effects of CO2 on tree growth is crucial for ecotones, where increased climate stress could drive mortality and shifts in range. Here, we quantify the effects of climate, stand structure, and rising CO2 on both annual tree-ring growth increment and intrinsic WUE (iWUE) at a savanna-forest boundary in the Upper Midwest United States. Taking a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach, we find that plant iWUE increased by ~ 16–23% over the course of the twentieth century, but on average, tree-ring growth increments do not significantly increase. Consistent with higher iWUE under increased CO2 and recent wetting, we observe a decrease in sensitivity of tree growth to annual precipitation, leading to ~ 35–41% higher growth under dry conditions compared to trees of similar size in the past. However, an emerging interaction between summer maximum temperatures and annual precipitation diminishes the water-savings benefit under hot and dry conditions. This decrease in precipitation sensitivity, and the interaction between temperature and precipitation are strongest in open canopy microclimates, suggesting that stand structure may modulate response to future changes. Overall, while higher iWUE may provide some water savings benefits to growth under normal drought conditions, near-term future temperature increases combined with drought events could drive growth declines of about 50%."

Are interactions and feedbacks between species, or species responses to the environment more important constraints on aboveground biomass? Are these feedbacks and environmental responses constant over time?\nBoth environmental gradients and interactions between tree species can influence the geographic distribution of different species and the total biomass stored on the landscape. Thus, our ability to forecast responses to climatic changes depends on both species responses to environmental limits, and the competitive or facilitative interactions between species.\nI used a Generalized Joint Attribute Modelling (GJAM) approach to quantify past (1800’s) and modern (2000’s) species responses to environmental gradients in the US Midwest, and identify strong interactions between species that are not due to common environmental sensitivities. I show that while environmental responses are relatively conserved over time, historical land use change and loss of late successional forests removed strong species interactions that historically led to high biomass forests."

    "text": "Many biodiversity studies that estimate the impact of climate change on species relay on spatial occurrence data and “climate envelope modelling,” which assume that a species or populations will respond to temporal changes in climate according to species-level climate responses inferred from spatial occurrences. In this project, we use a range-wide network of tree-ring time series data from Pinyon Pine (Pinus edulis) to show that individual-scale responses in growth are opposite in sign to species-scale responses inferred from occurrence data and spatial climate variation.\nWith Dr. Margaret Evans, Sharmila Dey, and John Tipton, we built Bayesian models of annual tree ring growth to estimate climate sensitivity across Pinus edulis’s species range, using tree cores sampled from &gt; 1500 trees in the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program plots in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado.\nThis work revealed a transient risk of extinction for this species, as most of the distribution of Pinus edulis experienced growth declines under hotter annual temperatures, despite a positive relationship between average growth and spatial variation in temperature, and positive effect of temperature on the cool edge of the distribution, estimated from occurance. This risk of extinction may require evolutionary change of individual-scale climate tolerances for a species to persist (evolutionary rescue)."
